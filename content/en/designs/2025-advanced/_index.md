Built around a modular carbon fibre and 3D-printed frame, the aircraft features a 1.2â€¯m wingspan with a Clark-Y airfoil for aerodynamic efficiency. Powered by three lightweight T-Motor MN2806 units and vectored front motors for vertical lift, it balances thrust and weight under strict competition limits. A Pixhawk 6C flight controller running ArduPilot handles navigation and stability, supported by a Raspberry Pi CM4 for onboard computer vision and RTK-enabled GNSS for precise positioning. The design emphasizes reliability, modularity, and repairability, offering a strong foundation for mission success in the SAE Advanced Class competition.
