## Overview
Featuring a cropped delta wing and T-tail layout, the design is optimized for payload capacity, durability, and ease of manufacturing. The airframe consists of a carbon fiber skeleton housed in a CNC-machined EPS foam body, allowing key components to be transferred between bodies in minutes. Powered by an E-flite Power 10 motor and supported by custom baffles for payload stability, the UOAN-M25 balances aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity.

## Construction
The plane is made from a single sheet of low-density **Dupontâ„¢** foam. The Density is further reduced by using a CNC mill to remove material in a way that maintains structural integrity. The shape of the airfoil is also created in this process.
