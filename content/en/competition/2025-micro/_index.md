## Overview
Featuring a cropped delta wing and T-tail layout, the design is optimized for payload capacity, durability, and ease of manufacturing. The airframe consists of a carbon fiber skeleton housed in a CNC-machined EPS foam body, allowing key components to be transferred between bodies in minutes. The single-piece design of the airframe results in high strength and durability. The aircraft is powered by an E-flite Power 10 motor and supported by custom baffles for payload stability.

## Construction
The plane is made from a single sheet of low-density **Dupontâ„¢** Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) foam, with carbon fiber tubing for added rigidity, held together by 3d printed PLA brackets. The Density is further reduced by using a CNC mill to remove material in a way that maintains structural integrity, while also making space for electronics, control servos, and the water payload. The shape of the airfoil is also created in this process.

## Airfoil

We chose a cropped delta delta wing to maximize the possible wing surface area with the chosen dimensions, since larger wingspans are penalized in scoring in the SAE Aero Design Micro Class.
