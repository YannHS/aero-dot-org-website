# Competition
### The uOttawa Aerospace Team is a *competitive team*, meaning, every year, we aim to compete head-to-head with other Universities' aircraft.

Both our Micro Class team and our Advanced Class team attended the SAE Aero Design Competition East in Dallas, Texas, in May of 2025. While the focus of SAE Aero Design is to design an original aircraft that meets the design requirements as best as possible, Attending competition events are a great way to validate our own design, gain inspiration from other team's original designs, and build connections with like-minded people from both industy and other Universities.

As [Described by SAE themselves](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/about-aero-design):

> The SAE Aero Design competition is intended to provide undergraduate and graduate engineering students with a real-life engineering challenge. The competition has been designed to provide exposure to the kinds of situations that engineers face in their real-life work environment. First and foremost a design competition, students will find themselves performing trade studies and making compromises to arrive at a design solution that will optimally meet the mission requirements while still conforming to the configuration limitations.
