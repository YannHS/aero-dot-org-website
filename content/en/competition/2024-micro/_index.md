## Airframe Construction

{{< columns count=2 >}}

{{< column >}}

The 2024 Micro Class aircraft uses an airframe made from mostly 3d printed parts with some laser-cut balsa for the wings all mounted to carbon bars for strength and rigidity. The heavy use of 3d printed parts allows for complex shapes to be produced by a team with little experience building aircraft together. For 3d printed parts, a foaming PLA filament was used to reduce density where structural integrity is less essential.

## Wing Construction

{{< columns count=2 >}}

{{< column >}}

Laser-cut balsa wood in the shape of the *Selig S1223* airfoil is used to hold the airfoil in the wings, which is then coated with monokote to produce the actual wing shape. 3d printed wingtips have the purpose of reducing wingtip vorticies to try and eek out as much lift from the limited wingspan.

## Control Mechanisms

{{< columns count=2 >}}

{{< column >}}

In order to maintain a high degree of control authority, our aircraft uses a combination of tilting rotors and individually tilting V-tail surfaces. The tilting rotors allows the aircraft to perform thrust vectoring instead of using traditional ailerons on the main wing, reducing wing construction complexity. The rotors are able to be deflected ±20°.
