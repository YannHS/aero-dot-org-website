## We give *Real World, Practical* experience to uOttawa students

 Centering team motivation behind the SAE Aero Design competition is an effective way to get feedback for our designs from industry professionals and to keep the team united towards a single goal. Students get to chose, based on their abilities and knowledge, one of our two subteams: **Micro** or **Advanced**. These subteams are not strictly isolated; members can work on whichever tasks suits them best. This approach makes sure that students from a variety of backgrounds can find their own role on the team.

## Micro
This subteam works towards designing and manufacturing an aircraft for the **SAE Aero Design Micro Class**. 

![](img/micro-simple.png)

The goal for Micro Class is to make an aircraft that can take off in the shortest distance possible, with a small wingspan and power limit of 500w. The aircraft must also be able to hold a water payload, with incentives for holding more water while in flight.

> Micro Class teams are required to make trades between two potentially conflicting requirements, carrying the highest payload fraction possible, while simultaneously pursuing the lowest empty weight possible. -[SAE](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/about-aero-design)

## Advanced


This subteam works towards designing and manufacturing an aircraft for the **SAE Aero Design Advanced Class**. 

![](img/advanced-simple.png)

The goal for Advanced Class is to make an autonomous aircraft that can deliver and pickup a payload, land tand takeoff horizontally, all with a limit of ~1.5 kg (payload included) and a maximum of 3 rotors.

> Advanced Class requires teams to have a systems approach to the design while integrating several engineering disciplines: aeronautical, mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers. The ultimate end goal for this class is autonomous flight with a "purpose" decided every year by rules committee members. -[SAE](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/about-aero-design)
