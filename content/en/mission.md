## We give *Real World, Practical* experience to uOttawa students

 Students get to apply the skills they learn in class in our two subteams: **Micro** and **Advanced**. These subteams are not strictly isolated; members can work on whichever tasks suits them best.

## Micro
This subteam works towards designing and manufacturing an aircraft for the **SAE Aero Design Micro Class**. 

![](img/micro-simple.png)

The goal for Micro Class is to make an aircraft that can take off in the shortest distance possible, with a small wingspan and power limit of 500w. The aircraft must also be able to hold a water payload, with incentives for holding more water while in flight.

> Micro Class teams are required to make trades between two potentially conflicting requirements, carrying the highest payload fraction possible, while simultaneously pursuing the lowest empty weight possible. -[SAE](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/about-aero-design)

## Advanced


This subteam works towards designing and manufacturing an aircraft for the **SAE Aero Design Advanced Class**. 

![](img/advanced-simple.png)

The goal for Advanced Class is to make an autonomous aircraft that can deliver and pickup a payload, land tand takeoff horizontally, all with a limit of ~1.5 kg (payload included) and a maximum of 3 rotors.

> Advanced Class requires teams to have a systems approach to the design while integrating several engineering disciplines: aeronautical, mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers. The ultimate end goal for this class is autonomous flight with a "purpose" decided every year by rules committee members. -[SAE](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/about-aero-design)
